		<h3>Week 1 Blog Post:</h3>
		
		<p>
		Setting up GitHub:
		<br>
		When I first downloaded GitHub and tried to wrap my head around it without any outside information it seemed unnecessarily obtuse. After watching some of the videos 
		uploaded to Ulwazi explaining how to navigate around GitHub and GitHub desktop, its uses and functionality became a little more clearer. I did still watch further, somewhat
		more concise, YouTube videos to wrap my head around GitHub (specifically the desktop version) to make sure I understood what most of the relevant features were meant to do 
		and to start learning how to use it more collaboratively (my group in another course discussed using GitHub for our project). After an hour or so of messing around with 
		GitHub and following some tutorials on how to use it I was far more familiar with the program.

		<br><br>
		Reflections on the reading:
		<br>
		The Library of Babel covers ideas on human existence, namely our need for a greater meaning, order in a seemingly chaotic world, and how our pursiuits of knowledge and 
		meaning are pointless. The reading creates a ficitional reality where the universe and everything that goes on in it is analogous to an endless library with books stored 
		in heaxagonal chambers that have endless variations on the alphabet. These chambers extending, seemingly, endlessly in all directions store every book about every subject 
		that could possibly exist. This includes every event and idea in every possible language with as many variations of these as possible. Humans in this infinite library 
		search endlessly for different knowledge (sometimes variations of the same thing) in order to find some higher meaning for the library, their own existences or they just 
		embrace the randomness of the library. The short story tries to get us to reflect on our own attempts to find meaning, order, and higher power in the randomness of our own 
		universe through religion, science, philosophy etc. It also makes us contemplate the difference between meaningless information and knowledge and the infinite meanings that 
		can be stored in the meaningless information. The library has notable similarities to the internet and how easy it is to find information anywhere and everywhere in near 
		endless variations but there could still be a lack of knowledge gained. The internet, like the library, can store near infinite amouonts of information but that information 
		is meaningless to us if it's hard to access or understand.

		<br><br>
		Your goals for the course:
		<br>
		My goals for the course are to fully engage with the theory and learn enough of the coding language for web development so that I begin web design and start experimenting 
		with UI/UX.

		<h3>Week 2 Blog Post:</h2>

		<p>
		Starting with HTML:
		<br>
		HTML, unlike programming languages like C#, are a lot easier to grasp for beginners from my expeerience. The language is a lot more straight forward with its naming that 
		makes it easier to get into. The hardest part of using html for me is creating clean code that is easy to navigate/read and that follows a clear heirarchy. 

		<br><br>
		Reflection on the readings:
		<br>
		The "why You Should Choose HTML5" reading introduced me to sectioning, section and article tags, and the pros of cons of each (mainly the section tag cons). The article tag 
		will be useful when I begin coding for my website in that it will help streamline my workflow so I do not have to constantly be thinking about placing the proper heading 
		tags but i ca instead nest heading tags in an article and a heirarchy of headings will form. The readings also discussed how sectioning can help screen reader users better 
		navigate your website through its clear indication of where a piece of information begins and ends like a summary of an article.

		<br><br>
		<em>Reflection on Internet Histories:</em>
		<br>
		It is interesting to see how the internet developed into the large interconnected web of information it is today and how much of this development was a result of necessity: 
		people wanted to archive information they could not access on the internet, creating services that could be accessed more easily online, ways to find information faster etc.

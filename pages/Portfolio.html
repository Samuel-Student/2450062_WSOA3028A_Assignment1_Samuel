					<p>Goal Alignment:
					My goals for this website were to make a simple and clean UI with an easy to understand interface that clearly shows what content I am trying to display (photography). I wanted them to easily navigate through the homepage, seeing the photos (most important) and the menu on the left of the page if they wanted more information. My users are people interested in working with me in the future with photography. They would come to my website to view my portfolio work and find a way to contact me.
					</p>

					<p><br></p>

					<p>User Flow:
					The user should first look at the logo and the name of the website in the top left corner of the screen because of how people read media. After this their attention should move to the images, being the largest part of the homepage. The last thing they should see is the menu on the left. The images are scrollable and require the users to scroll to engage with all the content.
					</p>

					<p><br></p>

					<p>Interface Elements:
					All the interface elements I use in the website are buttons. The user will use buttons to navigate around the website. They are able to scroll on the left side of the page.
					</p>

					<p><br></p>

					<p>Style Process Documentation:
					 I pulled much of my visual aesthetic from the website YEAR0001 for the swedish recording label:
					 </p>
					 <a href="https://year0001.com" target="_blank">https://year0001.com</a>

					 <p><br></p>

					 <p>I used a very open design with a large amount of negative space. I wanted to focus more on the photography in the website though so I made the images a lot larger to bring more attention to them. The font I used, Nanum Gothic Coding, was inspired by the one used by YEAR0001 in its feel. I went for a minimalistic colour palette (black and white) to only focus on the images and to make all the text stand out adequately.
